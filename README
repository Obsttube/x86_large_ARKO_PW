description:	"Big" INTEL x86 project - finding 8th-type marker in a BMP file with arbitrary dimensions.
usage:			find_markers [options]
options:
  -f <filename>		Find markers in the <filename> file.
  -t				Find markers in all files in the 'tests' directory and compare them with the correct output.
						Eg. test1.o contains correct output for the test1.bmp file.


example usage:
  ./find_markers -t
  ./find_markers -f example.bmp
  ./find_markers -f tests/test0.bmp
  ./find_markers -f example.bmp -t
  ./find_markers -tf example.bmp


Tests should be put in the 'tests' folder. Each test file should have a corresponding output file.
For example, the correct output for test1.bmp file is in test1.o
Output for ./find_markers -f tests/test1.bmp:
"
103, 238
309, 67
309, 33
"
Contents of tests/test1.o:
"
103, 238
309, 67
309, 33

" (file ends with an empty line)


building the project:
  a) Just use the "make" command.
  b) Use the provided test.sh file for faster testing. It automatically cleans, builds, starts the program and print errors if they exist.
		It used to be helpful in some stages of developement.
